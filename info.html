      <h3>HISTORY</h3>
      <p> Arvada West, as well as a majority of high schools in the area, has charged admission for choir concerts for many years. With
        shrinking budgets, high school arts/athletics/activities have historically become more and more self-sustaining - meaning they 
        have to generate most of the funds to run the program year to year. Admission is a vital fundraiser for choir, theatre, musicals,
        athletics, dances, and many other events/programs at AWHS.</p>
      <h3>WHAT DOES THE MONEY GO TOWARDS?</h3>
      <p>Our budget exceeds $20,000 annually, which goes towards accompanist salaries/assistant director salaries, sheet music, office 
        running costs, transportation, festivals, purchasing/maintaining concert robes, piano/instrument maintenance/tuning, guest 
        clinicians, recording sessions, audition fees, and many others. By charging a modest admission fee to our performances, we are 
        able to "spread out" some of the financial contribution across our supportive community - eliminating the all-too-common 
        situation of a small percentage of the community contributing most of the effort.</p>  
      <h3>QUALITY</h3>
      <p>While the choir department is dependent upon fundraisers such as concert admission, we guarantee to put on a show, making the 
        cost of your ticket well worth it! We have one of the premiere performing arts programs in Colorado, and our talented students 
        work their tails off to present a top-shelf product at our concerts! </p>
